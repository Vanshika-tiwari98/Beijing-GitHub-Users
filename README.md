I used GitHub API to Search for Users who belong Beijing with more over 500 followers, and their recent repositories then i cleaned data for company name after that i save my data in csv file.
The most surprising thing i find the user have top most followers are using java as their programming language.
Developers in beijing should more focus on project based on java.
